Web samples

## See the samples in action

Compiled versions of the samples are hosted at
[flutter.github.io/samples][samples].

## Building samples code

Go into one of the sample directories, get packages, and run using the `chrome`
device:

```console
$ flutter channel dev
$ flutter upgrade
$ cd gallery
$ flutter pub get
$ flutter run -d chrome
```

Web support is available as a technical preview and is only available in the
`dev` or `master` channels.

You should see a message printing the URL to access: `http://localhost:8080`
