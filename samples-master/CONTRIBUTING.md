# Contributing

_See also: [Flutter's code of conduct](https://flutter.io/design-principles/#code-of-conduct)_

Want to contribute to the Flutter sample ecosystem? Great! First, read this
page (including the small print at the end).

## Is this the right place for your contribution?

This repo is used by members of the Flutter team and a few partners as a place
to store example apps and demos. It's not meant to be the one and only source of
truth for Flutter samples or the only place people go to learn about the best
ways to build with Flutter. What that means in practice is that if you've
written a great example app, it doesn't need to be maintained here in order to
get noticed, be of help to new Flutter devs, and have an impact on the
community.

You can maintain your sample app in your own repo (or with another source
control provider) and still be as important a part of the Flutter-verse as
anything you see here. You can let us know on the
[FlutterDev Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/flutter-dev)
when you've published something and Tweet about it with the
[#flutterio](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23flutterio) hashtag.

## So what should be contributed here, then?

Fixes and necessary improvements to the existing samples, mostly.

## Before you contribute

Before we can use your code, you must sign the
[Google Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://cla.developers.google.com/about/google-individual)
(CLA), which you can do online. The CLA is necessary mainly because you own the
copyright to your changes, even after your contribution becomes part of our
codebase, so we need your permission to use and distribute your code. We also
need to be sure of various other thingsâ€”for instance that you'll tell us if you
know that your code infringes on other people's patents. You don't have to sign
the CLA until after you've submitted your code for review and a member has
approved it, but you must do it before we can put your code into our codebase.

Before you start working on a larger contribution, you should get in touch with
us first through the issue tracker with your idea so that we can help out and
possibly guide you. Coordinating up front makes it much easier to avoid
frustration later on.
